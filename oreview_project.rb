# What You'll Be Building
# This project will help you create a small program that will read a userâ€™s input and correct his or her capitalization. Users can provide an almost infinite range of input, so it makes our lives easier as programmers to make their input standard before doing anything with it.


print "What's your first name? "
first_name = gets.chomp
first_name.capitalize!

print "What's your last name? "
last_name = gets.chomp
last_name.capitalize!

print "What city are you from? "
city = gets.chomp
city.capitalize!

print "What state or province are you from? "
state = gets.chomp
state.upcase!

puts "Your name is #{first_name} #{last_name} and you're from #{city}, #{state}!"
