# INTRODUCTION TO RUBY
# Overview & Sneak Peek
# Ruby is a powerful, flexible programming language you can use in web/Internet development, to process text, to create games, and as part of the popular Ruby on Rails web framework. Ruby is:

# High-level, meaning reading and writing Ruby is really easy—it looks a lot like regular English!

# Interpreted, meaning you don’t need a compiler to write and run Ruby. You can write it here at Codecademy or even on your own computer (many are shipped with the Ruby interpreter built in—we’ll get to the interpreter later in this lesson).

# Object-oriented, meaning it allows users to manipulate data structures called objects in order to build and execute programs. We’ll learn more about objects later, but for now, all you need to know is everything in Ruby is an object.

# Easy to use. Ruby was designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto (often just called “Matz”) in 1995. Matz set out to design a language that emphasized human needs over those of the computer, which is why Ruby is so easy to pick up.

# This course assumes no previous knowledge of Ruby in particular or programming/computer science in general.

# Data Types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans
# In Ruby, your information (or data) can come in different types. There are three data types in Ruby that we’re interested in right now: Numeric (any number), Boolean (which can be true or false), and String (words or phrases like "I'm learning Ruby!").

# Computer programs exist to quickly analyze and manipulate data. For that reason, it’s important for us to understand the different data types that we can use in our programs.

# Reminder: never use quotation marks (‘ or “) with booleans, or Ruby will think you’re talking about a string (a word or phrase) instead of a value that can be true or false. It’s also important to remember that Ruby is case-sensitive (it cares about capitalization).

my_num =   25  # Add your code here!

my_boolean =   true  # And here!

my_string =   "Ruby"  # Also here.

puts my_num
puts my_boolean
puts my_string
